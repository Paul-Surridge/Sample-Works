Please Note:

	- Netbeans IDE was used for the development of the x3 projects given that it freely supported embedded Java database:

		Netbeans: 12.1
		Java: 1.8.0_261
		JDK: 8u261 Windows x64
		JRE: SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_261-b12
		Scene Builder: 2.0

	- However for convenience all x3 projects contain the following x2 folders:

		nbproject:	Folder containing configuration for Netbeans
		.idea:		Folder containing configuration for IntelliJ

	- Therefore it should be possible to review/run all x3 projects straight away from within either Netbeans or Intellij.
