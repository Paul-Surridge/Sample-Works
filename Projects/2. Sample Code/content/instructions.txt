Welcome to Sample Code

	Overview

		- Sample Code is a simple, quick and efficent store, search and retrieval of research notes or previous working pieces of source code.
		- Build up library by adding nodes.
		- Library stored and backed by a simple JavaDB/Derby database.

	Library Tree Context Menu:
									Required
		[Right click]						Focus			Action
		___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

		Assign Icon						Library Tree Node	Assign icon to node, local branch or all decendent branches.
		Expand:							Library Tree Node	Expand node or all decendents.
		Collapse:						Library Tree Node	Collapse node or all decendents.
 


	Search Procedure:

		1. Library:		Select a node:

						Selected Node		Action
						___________________________________________________________________________________________

						Root Node:		Search whole Library.
						Parent Node:		Search within branch and all decendent branches.
						Leaf Node:		Search within the leaf nodes own branch and all decendent branches.

		2. Search Fragment:	Type the string or fragment to be searched, the focus will automatically jump to search text field, use | to search for multiple items:

						map | iterator	//Search for all instances of 'map' and 'iterator', all searches are case insensitive.

		3. Search Scope:	Toggle to search within:

						Node Name | Node Code

		4. [Enter]: 		Run search and a new tree will be built containing all nodes containing the searched word(s).
		5. Click Node:		Select node to open.
		6. Browse:		Use the cursor up/down to jump through all instances of searched word(s).
		7. [Escape]:		To return library.



	AutoSave:

		1. Select a node and alter either node name or content.
		2. Select another node.
		3. Original node is automatically saved.
		4. Disk save icon will appear in top right hand corner.
