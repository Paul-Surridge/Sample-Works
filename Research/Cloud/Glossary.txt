	0:

		- Any port (allow any connection on any port)

	Alpine:

		- Generic term for an image which is as small and compact as possible.
		- For example a popular repository will offer an 'alpine' version of an image which is the minimal and most compact version of the functionality of that particular repository.

	Backing Service:

		- Any service which is consumed by an application during normal operation and are attached/connected/associated with the application for the life of application:

			Database
			Queue
			Memory Cache
			SMTP/FTP

		- Typically via a API driven RESTful web service.

	Boomark:

		- Bookmarking a volume is an instruction to a running container to not attempt to reference a corresponding volume of the same name on the local file system. 

	Bounded Context:

		- The operational boundary within the business that a particular microservice is responsible for and operates.

	Build Cache:

		- Location where the previously downloaded/used images are stored within docker-client.
		- Reducing the need to download again, whereby significantly increasing container creation and spin up.

	Build Context:

		- The project directory on local machine i.e. the directory that forms the natural boundary for the build process within Docker.

		- Commoditization is a process in which a product or a service becomes so common that the consumers cannot differentiate between the different brands offering the product or the service.
		- This way a product becomes a commodity.

	Component:

		- Component refers to any collection of entities which collectively form a functional unit.
		- Component may refer to a collection of objects, interfaces or microservices.

	Configuration File:

		- Build tools, platforms, servers, automation tools/technologies typically use a configuration of some sorts.
		- Configuration make take the form of a YAML or JSON file to provide the general role of providing the ability to configure and 'program' the consumer of that file.
		- The 'configuration' is the general term for this aspect of the technology.

	Container:

		- Lightweight.
		- Runs x1 image.
		- An instance of an image.
		- Allocated own memory, network and resources in general.
		- Container should not be thought of a physical construct in memory but x1 or more processes with specific resources (which may be segmented) assigned to it.
		- Container contains the File System defined and contained within the image.
		- Container once finished will be listed as 'Exited' but may be rerun and does not need to be recreated.
		- No external access to any internal aspects of the container however each process running within container can be accessed via following channels:

			stdin
			stdout
			stderr

	Container ID:

		- Unique ID for each container.
		- Unique ID as generated when building the image of the container, therefore also can be considered the 'Image ID' which then becomes the 'Container ID' once spun up in a container.

	Continuous Delivery:

		- Development methodology whereby incremental changes to a program are collated and decided when to be pushed to production.

	Continuous Deployment:

		- Development methodology whereby incremental changes to a program are continually and immediately pushed to production.

	Continuous Integration:

		- Development methodology whereby incremental changes are continually built and tested, whereby ensuring that there is always a testable build and avoid merge conflucts.

	Control Groups (cgroups):

		- Similar to namespacing which isolate resources from processes.
		- Control Groups limit resources from processes (not isolate/segregate completely).
		- Control Groups may limit CPU, network bandwidth, HD I/O.

	File System:

		- File system is the collection of files/memory that is contained within and used by the container.
		- File system is the 'mini hardrive' within the container, the segmented portionn of the local computer.

	Horizontal Scaling:

		- Increasing capacity by adding more instances of a resource rather than adding or increasing the capactity of an existing existing resource e.g. increasing the number of nodes in a cluster.

	IaaS:

		- IaaS 'Infrastructure as a service'.
		- IaaS customers purchase and utilise VM's (Virtual Machines).
		- IaaS customers pay for the resources and services to run the applications from the moment that they are commissioned until they are explicitly decommissioned.
	
	Image:

		- x1 single file that contains all files, dependencies, config that is required to run within a container.
		- Image contains:

			File System Snapshot:		A collection of physical files and file references collectively known as the container 'File System'
			Startup Command:		A string which defines the startup command (which is called from CLI, therefore must be a command the CLI would understand) to start and run container e.g. 'run hello-world'

	Image Cache:

		- Local repository on local machine containing previously run images.

	Image ID:
