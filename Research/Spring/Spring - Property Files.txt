Spring

	Property Files:

		- Property files are *.properties
		- Property files contain key:value pairs used within the configuration of the application.
		- Property files are located within:

			core/.../resources/config/

		- Property files enable quick modification of an applications configuration without modifiying and recompiling any of the source code.
		- Property files:

			# game properties
			game.maxNumber = 100
			game.guessCount = 10

			NB:
				- # denotes comment.
				- Space before and after = is optional.
				- game. is a prefix purely to create a namespace i.e. it could be removed if required.
		
		- Property files are accessed via @PropertySource inconjunction with @Value:

			@Configuration
			@PropertySource("classpath:config/game.properties")
			public class GameConfig {

    			    // == fields ==
    			    @Value("${game.maxNumber:20}")
    			    private int maxNumber = 100;
			}

			NB:
				- The syntax for referencing the key:value within the *.properties file is of the same format as when using properties withn the maven *.pom file e.g. ${game.maxNumber} ${java.version}
				- Successful insertion of values are reflected in the console output via 'Found key':

				> o.s.c.e.PropertySourcesPropertyResolver - Found key 'game.maxNumber' in PropertySource 'class path resource [config/game.properties]' with value of type String

		- Property files store all key@value pairs as strings, the values are converted to the appropriate type when inserted into the fields (when a value cannot be inserted an exception will be thrown).
