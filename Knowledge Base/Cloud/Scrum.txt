Scrum Development

	Overview:

		- Scrum is an implementation of Agile.
		- Scrum allows for controlled incremental works to a product.
		- Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, organisations to generate value through solutions which are adaptive and evolve with the development process.
		- Scrum is founded on:

			1. Empiricism:			Knowledge and decisions are based upon experience and what is observed.
			2. Lean Thinking:		Reduce waste and only focus on the essential.

		- Scrum is an iterative process which:

			1. Predictability:		Increase and optimise predictability.
			2. Risk:			Control and minimise risk.

		- Scrum implements x3 pillars:

			1. Transparency
			2. Inspection
			3. Adaption

	Waterfall:

		- Prior to scrum dvelopment typically followed a waterfall pattern:

			1.	Plan
			2.		Build
			3.			Test
			4.				Review
			5.					Deploy

		- Duration:

			- Each stage may take several months. 
			- Potentially alot of resource/time just to complete x1 product.

		- Rigid:

			- Design/requirements may shift during excessively long development time.
			- Not easy to apply any changes to features or direction of product.
			- Not possible to completely plan given potentially many unknonws down the line.
			- Changes may require going back a step or creating a new plan of works completely.

	Scrum Components:

		Roles				Artifacts (Documents)			Sprint Events (Processes)
		________________________________________________________________________________________

		1. Product Owner		1. Product Goal				1. Sprint
		2. Scrum Master			2. Product Backlog			    2. Plan
		3. Developers			3. Sprint Backlog			    3. Development
						    4. Sprint Goal			    4. Review
						    5. Items				    5. Retrospective
						    6. Plan of Delivery
						    7. Burndown Chart
						8. Increment (of Value)

	Scrum Workflow:

		1. Product Owner:

			- Product Goal:		Holder.
			- Product Backlog:	Creator and holder.

		2. Sprint:

			Start:

				1. [Event/Meeting] Planning:

					1. Product Backlog:

						- Product Owner reviews current Product Backlog.
						- Product Owner arranges and prioritises the items on the Product Backlog.

					2. Spring Backlog:

						- Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers discuss, decide and commit which items (Features/'User Stories') from the Product Backlog to be included in the Sprint Backlog.
						- Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers all now have solid understand of what shall constitute the next sprint.

							Sprint Backlog represents:	Sprint Goal
							Sprint Backlog represents:	Increment of Value

				2. [Phase] Development:

					1. Development:			Work through items on Sprint Backlog.
					2. Daily Scrum:			Assess progress through Sprint Backlog highlighting, discussing and addressing any bottlenecks/issues.

					[Repeat until the Sprint Backlog is complete (1-3 weeks)]

				3. [Event/Meeting] Review:

					1. Demo:			Demo Increment to Product Owner.
					2. Shippable Product:		Ensure that at the end of the Sprint it still produces/leaves an overall Shippable Product that contains the Increment of Value.

				4. [Event/Meeting] Retrospective:

					1. Spring Improvements:		Assess, evaluate and how to improve the Sprint process. 

			End:

		3. Repeat until Product Backlog has been finished and the product is 'feature complete'.

	Scrum Team:

		- Scrum team contains all x3 roles:

			 Scrum Team ____________________
			|				|
			|	Product Owner		|
			|	|			|
			|	Scrum Master		|
			|	|			|
			|	Developers		|
			|_______________________________|

		- Scrum team sole objective is ultimately to reach the Product Goal via Sprints.
		- Scrum team is self-contained and self-managing unit.
		- Scrum team is responsible and internally decides all aspects required to reach Product Goal.
		- Scrum team should be afforded the necessary structure to complete their works by the external organisation.
		- Scrum team size is typically > 10.
		- Scrum teams which are smaller tend to be more productive.
		- Scrum teams which are too large should consider breaking into smaller multiple cohesive teams which all share the same:

	Scrum Roles:

		Product Owner:

			- Responsibilities:

				1. Maximise Value:		Maximise value derived from the Scrum Team in each Sprint working towards the Product Goal.

				2. Product Backlog:

					Items:			Define and decide the items to be included in Product Backlog.
					Maintain:		Maintain and prioritise items in Product Backlog.
					Clarity:		Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and fully understood by all members of the Scrum Team.

			- Product Owner may delegate the above to others but overall remains responsible.
			- Product Owner is x1 person (not a committee) but may represent multiple internal/external stakeholders associated with the Product.
			- Product Owner may be convinced to alter the Product Backlog but ultimately it is their decision.

		Scrum Master:

			- Responsibilities:

				1. Standards:			Establish and maintain Scrum Standards as defined in the Scrum Guide.
				2. Effectiveness:		Establish and maintain Scrum Team effectivness through continual learning and improvement within the Scrum Framework.
				3. Coach:			Coach Developers in self-management, cross-roles and cross-functionality.
				4. Implementation:		Ensure that the Developers deliver quality in accordance with the 'Definition of Done'.
				5. Impediments:			Remove any impediments to the Developers progress.
				6. Time Keeping:		Ensure that all Scrum events do take place and are positive, productive and kept within the timeframe.

			- Serves:

				1. Product Owner

					1. Product Goal:	Assist with Product Goal:		Help find techniques for improved management and establishing empirical product planning.
					2. Product Backlog:	Assist with Product Backlog:		Help find techniques for improved management and maintaining clarity with all members of Scrum Team.
					3. Collaboration:	Assist facilitating collaboration between all Stakeholders when required.
 
				2. Organisation

					1. Scrum Adoption:	Promote, lead and train Scrum adoption within the organisation and the empirical assessment of complex works.
					3. Barrier Reduction:	Reduce barriers between Stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

		Developers:

			- Responsibilities:

				1. Sprint Backlog:		Create Sprint Backlog in accordance with the items committed from the Product Backlog to be included in this Sprint.  
				2. Sprint Goal:			Daily accessment of progress and if necessary adapting the plan to ensure being able to meet the Sprint Goal.
				3. Definition of Done:		Ensuring quality and meeting the 'Definition of Done'.
				4. Accountability:		Holding each other accountable as professionals. 

			- Developers have multiple roles e.g. rotating the roles of Developer, Testing or anything else needed to meet the Sprint Goal.

	Scrum Artifacts (Documents):

		1. Product Goal:

			- Produced by:	Organisation
			- Managed by:	Organisation
			- Description:

				- Product:		Complete overview of the entire product including all features.

		2. Product Backlog

			- Produced by:	Product Owner.
			- Managed by:	Product Owner.
			- Description:

				- List:			List of all items that constitute the Product Goal.
				- Open to Change:	List is open to change in priority and content as the product develops with every Sprint.
				- Priortisation:	List order of priority and content managed by the Product Owner.

		3. Sprint Backlog

			- Produced by:	Team: Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers.
			- Managed by:	n/a
			- Description:

				- Sprint Works:		List of all agreed items that are committed to and to be contained in this Sprint including the following artifacts:

								1. Sprint Goal
								2. Product Backlog [selected] items
								3. Plan of Delivery

			- Derived Artifacts:

				1. Sprint Goal:			Sprint Backlog constitutes the Sprint Goal.
				2. Burndown Chart:		Chart illustrating the progress through the Sprint Backlog, approaches 0 as the works are being completed.
				3. Increment (of Value):	Value that has been added to the product over the course of the Sprint.

	Scrum Events:

		- Event is both a constituent part and marker within the Sprint.
		- Event is a formal opportunity to discuss, inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
		- Event aids transparency.
		- Event which do not occur form lost opportunities to discuss, inspect and adapt i.e. 'keep things on track'.
		- Event held as specified help to reduce unscheduled meetings outside of Scrum framework.
		- Event are held in same time/place to reduce complexity.
		- Event types (x5):

			1. Sprint:

				- Sprint is the container event which houses the other x4 core events:

					Scrum Sprint
					 _______________________________
					|				|
					|	Planning		|
					|	|			|
					|	Daily Scrum(s)		|
					|	|			|
					|	Review			|
					|	|			|
					|	Retrospective		|
					|_______________________________|

				- Sprint is the process of converting a Sprint Backlog into an Increment (of value).
				- Sprint is immediately subsequent of the previous Sprint.
				- Sprint is one month or less to ensure consistency.
				- Sprint is a container for all other events.
				- Sprint is a container for all works necessary to complete the Sprint Backlog thereby completing an Increment (of value) towards the Product Goal.
				- Sprint is a process which generally ensures:

					1. No Changes:			No changes that would alter the Sprint Backlog.
					2. No Decrease in Quality:	No decrease in quality as defined by the 'Definition of Done'.

				- Sprint is a process which generally allows:

					1. Product Goal:		Product Goal to be regularly assessed, inspected and adapted on a regular basis.  
					2. Product Backlog:		Product Backlog to be refined as necessary on a regular basis e.g. add, remove or reordering of priority.

				- Sprint horizon should always be kept within a suitable timeframe, anything longer than x1 month may lead to:

					1. Invalid Sprint Goal
					2. Increased complexity
					3. Increased risk
					4. Increased cost

				- Sprint should be considered a 'short project' in itself.
				- Sprint may be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
				- Sprint may be cancelled by the Product Owner only.
				- Sprint should be organised to always ensure that a shippable product can be deployed at the end of the Sprint if required
				- Sprint initial Sprint Goal should be 'just enough' to be able to get a shippable product.

			2. Planning:

				- Planning produces the Sprint Backlog.
				- Planning is collaborative involving all members of the Scrum Team.
				- Planning may also involve other people in order to provide advice.
				- Planning typically the following discussion points:

					1. Value:		What is the overall value of this Sprint.
					2. Sprint Backlog:

						What:		What items from the Product Backlog will be included within Sprint Backlog.
						How:		How items will be implemented.

									- Developers are the sole members of the Team which determine how the items are done.

						Duration:	How long to be implemented.

									- Developers decompose the items into smaller items (normally of a day in size).
									- Developers are the sole members of the Team who determine the duration.

					3. Refine:		Scrum Team may discuss and refine the items to be included in Sprint Backlog in order to increase clarity, understanding and confidence.
					
				- Planning is timeboxed to x8 hours for x1 month Sprint.

			3. Daily Scrum:

				- Scrum is to inspect progress and where necessary adapt Sprint Backlog.
				- Scrum is x15 minutes and held in same time/place each day to maintain consistency and reduce complexity.
				- Scrum is for the actual Developers, however should the Scrum Masters and Product Owner also be operating as Developers they may participate.
				- Scrum is open to any format or technique proposed/decided by the Developers as long as is focused on progress towards completing Sprint Backlog.
				- Scrum is to produce an actionable plan for the days work whilst stimulating focus and self-management within the Developers.
				- Scrum is to discuss:

					1. Impediments:		Quickly identify issues or impediments that are holding up progress.
					2. Decision Making:	Quick decision making.
					3. Reduce Meetings:	Reduce the need for further meetings outside of the Scrum Framework or otherwise.
					4. Communication:	Improve communication within the Team.
					5. Progress:		What has been achieved since the last Scrum Meeting.
					6. Allocation:		What each Team Member is working on and how it is going.
					7. Assistance:		Who may need help within their works.

				- Scrum is not exclusively the only place where Developers may meed to adapt the Sprint Backlog, Developers may meet at anytime if necessary.
 
			4. Review:

				- Review occurs at the end of the Sprint.
				- Review is to:
			
					1. Demo:		Demonstrate the work completed during the Sprint to the Product Owner.
					2. Improvements:	What improvements can be added to the overall development process.
					3. Assess:		Assess, evaluate and inspect the outcome of the Sprint.
					4. Adaptions:		Identify possible future adaptions and works.

			5. Retrospective:

				- Retrospective is a review of the actual Sprint process rather than the output.
				- Retrospective is a review to assess, evaluate and understand how to improve the Sprint process. 

	Increment (of Value):

		- Increment of Value is typically shortened to 'Increment'.
		- Increment = x1 complete Sprint

	User Stories

		- A way of describing a Feature Set using simple to understand description of the requirements, typically:

			As a:		User/Salesman/Accountant		[A Role]
			I need:		To view the latest reports		[A Requirement]
			So that		To present at end of each month		[A Reason]

		- User Story provides a convenient and easy to understand means for a Product Owner to describe to the Scrum Master/Team what is required and how long it will take.
		- User Story provides the ability to specify just enough detail for the Scrum Master/Team to accurate gain an understanding of the works.
		- User Story is an item on the Product Backlog. 

	Blocked Items

		- Any aspect of the Sprint Backlog that is preventing stopping progress
